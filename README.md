# robot_instructions
## Instructions Catalog, and Reference Guide

### Overview
The intention for this repository is to facilitate efforts of USMA West Point cadets, faculty and collaborators to do useful work with robotic platforms in a relatively short time.  The repository has some resources in it, such as for networking and time synchronization, but is not intended to encapsulate a software package, or even a set of software packages in the same way as many repositories.  Instead, it provides some resources, and the instructions for using them, as well as a [wiki](https://github.com/westpoint-robotics/robot_instructions/wiki) that is meant to help you solve various problems in robotics both directly, and using references to other repositories and instruction sets.  Please contact any of the contributors to this repository with questions.

### TODO:
- Integrate [ATAK Bridge](https://github.com/westpoint-robotics/atak_bridge) somewhere.
- Build out Wiki
- Expand relevant repositories and instruction sets.
